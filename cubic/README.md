# Cubic Portfolio Template Repo

# Instructions  

You have to create a 3-D cubical block, which rotates and revolves on its own axis. The faces of the cube must be used to depict content. The content includes your hobbies, skills, likes, dislikes or whatever you need to present about yourself. The content must not be too bulky and vivid. You are free to use your own choice of colors and border styles and padding for efficient and clean presentation.
